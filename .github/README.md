# Visual Studio 2017 openFrameworks plugin

Allows to easily create new openFrameworks projects from inside Visual Studio 2017 and configure the addons in them.

For more info on how to use it check the openFrameworks setup guide for Visual Studio: 

http://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs
Note that the guide uses Visual Studio 2015, but the instructions still apply.

To develop it just open the top level solution, VSIXopenFrameworks.sln, in visual studio and press run to start the experimental version of Visual Studio which will run using the latest version of the plugin.

# Note
This project is an upgraded version from the original [Visual Studio 2015 extension](https://github.com/openframeworks/visualstudioPlugin), developed by by [@arturo](https://github.com/arturoc).
